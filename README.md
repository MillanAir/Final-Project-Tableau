# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Use the player ratings and other attributes to analyze player performance and identify patterns and trends.

## Process
### 1. Data Selection

After looking at the data I selected most useful columns in fifa18 database. Then I tried to make interesting visualization with the data provided in the fifa18 database. When I had 5-6 visualizations, I tried to come up with questions that can be explored in the data.

### 2. Dashboard and Story Creation

After carefully selecting the data, I made dashboards and stories to help explain my findings.

## Results

I chose option 2 and worked with Fifa 18 Data. I tried to answer the following questions:

What is the distribution of FIFA 18 players across different countries and what are their average ratings?

Which countries have the highest total player market value in FIFA 18?

Which countries have the highest average player ratings in FIFA 18, and how do they compare to other countries with more than 100 players?

What is the relationship between player value and player ratings in FIFA 18, and which players have the highest value and ratings?

How do the strength and potential ratings of clubs in FIFA 18 correlate with their overall ratings, and how does this vary across different clubs?

How do player ratings vary with age, and which age groups have the highest and lowest average ratings?

What is the relationship between player position and player ratings in FIFA 18, and which positions are preferred by top-rated players?

## Challenges 

Missing Time and date data in the dataset.

## Future Goals

I would like to create a heat map of player attributes by countries.
